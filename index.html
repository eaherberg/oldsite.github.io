			<h3>About Me</h3>
			
			<p>Hi, I’m Erik Herberg, a current graduate student at the University of Washington, aspiring community leader, and a lifelong learner. I have a dynamic background ranging from graphic design to educating professionals about social issues in higher education. My interests include educational leadership, community outreach, social justice, marketing, and most recently, computer sciences.</p>
			
			<p>As such, I have always strived to be knowledgeable in as many areas as possible as a way to spark innovation by combining different skillsets to seek out creative solutions to today’s changing social and economic climate. I am currently seeking a position where I can work with others and have the opportunity to demonstrate my abilities of creative problem solving, and social and economic awareness.</p>
			
			<p>Thank you for visiting my site. If you have any questions about my work, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:eaherberg@gmail.com">eaherberg@gmail.com</a>.</p>
