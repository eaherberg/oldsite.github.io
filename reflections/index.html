		<h3>Cumulative Reflection</h3><p>As I reflect on my graduate experience at the University of Washington, I realize that not only did it enhance my understanding of higher education, but it also enhanced my attitude toward education, others, and myself. Looking at my original statement of purpose for applying to my M.Ed. program, I noticed that I was very focused on illustrating myself as academically driven and having a genuine interest in working with college students. Although I still care about my academics and helping students, my time spent in many classes and my internship have propelled my understanding of higher education and the more systemic issues that need to be addressed. Throughout my coursework, I have noticed a common theme, which includes enhancing my understanding of how policies are affecting higher education’s development as socially equitable institution.</p>

<p>In the Fall quarter, my research included investigating inclusivity at the Ethnic Cultural Center (ECC) at the University of Washington and if it was truly welcoming to all students, or just a select few groups (EDLPS 590). Another project of mine during the Fall was investigating the bridge between education and the workforce in Washington State by doing a review of the State’s “High Skills, High Wages” strategic plan that aims to provide the needed services to all Washingtonians to meet the needs of today’s globalized, knowledge economy (EDLPS 563). My final project in the Fall consisted of conducting secondary data analysis and understanding the ways in which students’ progression through college is affected by their self-concept (e.g., feeling good about themselves, their relationships, their quality of work), where I discovered that students with higher self-concept are more likely to enroll in college (EDLPS 596).</p>

<p>In the Winter quarter, I was able to dive deeper into policy as I had a better understanding of how it affects higher education. For one of my projects, I investigated the ways in which policies affect the lifestyles of adjunct faculty in community colleges, where I found that promotion processes and other policies that govern faculty wages has a significant impact on their institutional and social identity (EDLPS 558). For another class, I looked into the complex processes of strategic planning in higher education, and aimed to find a way to simplify its meaning and processes through a metaphorical analysis. This project was especially interesting as it allowed me to think creatively about a very structured, linear process, and it introduced me to literature on strategic planning by Dr. Henry Mintzberg, which I used as the foundation of my paper (EDLPS 588). The project that I was most proud of during the Winter quarter was a policy memorandum I wrote that introduced the concept of Educational Equity, and how educating faculty about the social inequities within our current curriculums can be addressed by establishing a streamlined workshop program similar to a program offered at Bellevue College (EDLPS 586). My final project I completed during Winter quarter was one that I was also very proud of, which was a marketing plan that advanced ways for a university to implement strategies to enhance campus diversity (EDLPS 598: Marketing in Higher Education).</p>

<p>In the Spring quarter of the program, I took on three very different topics for my project assignments. One of the projects consisted of examining the trends of white male engagement on college campuses and the ways in which we can help white males become aware of their own culture and their white privilege to cultivate more culturally competent student populations (EDLPS 590). In another class, we focused on the effects of globalization and internationalization on higher education, which I used as an opportunity to combine both my personal and professional interests by examining the higher education systems in Scandinavia. For this project, I learned about the policies that Scandinavian countries have implemented that have truly affected the ways in which these countries are working hard to create a more culturally competent climate, as well as increase the First World’s understanding of Third World issues being caused by globalization (EDLPS 594). For another project I completed, I was able to dive into the business of higher education by investigating fundraising and donor relations in higher education (EDLPS 598C). My final project was another great opportunity for me to combine my role as a student with my role as a professional, where I designed an evaluation plan for my internship site—the Faculty Commons at Bellevue College (EDLPS 593). This was a very rewarding experience as it let me understand many of the processes going on in our department that I was not aware of or exposed to. Moreover, this project was gratifying as it gave me the opportunity to collaborate with my supervisors and design a plan that could be used one day in our department.</p>

<p>Reflecting across all of my projects and my course reflections, I was able to identify common themes throughout my experience in the Leadership in Higher Education program. The first theme is policy, which I have become more aware of and have routinely based my projects off of, such as policy-developing processes in higher education. The second theme is the understanding that higher education has become an enterprise. Essentially, I found that to have an effective policy or institution, you must have quality representation and branding. Because of this, I have routinely incorporated graphic design components and attractive, relevant language to my projects in efforts to highlight core deficits within the US higher education system as a way to bolster its awareness among stakeholders. Combined, these two themes have helped me identify the areas in which higher education needs to take greater steps in enhancing its image and practices. Many documents I read that covered key issues are routinely mundane and monotonous; we need to find ways to market higher education’s systemic issues to captivate greater audiences who can truly help make a difference.
Over the course of my coursework and professional experiences during the 2014 – 2015 academic year, it’s amazing to see my transformation from the student I was when I entered the LHE program; to the person I am today. I look forward to utilizing my newfound skills and competencies in issues of marketing, social justice, and policy in my future career, where I hope to become a community leader and work with students, the general public, and higher education institutions.</p>
