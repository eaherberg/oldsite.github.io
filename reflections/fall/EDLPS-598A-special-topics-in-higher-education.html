		<h3>EDLPS 598A: Special Topics in Higher Education</h3><h5>Fall 2014</h5>
<p>Over the past quarter it was great getting the opportunity to listen to some great speakers and their stories, and to learn more about the processes and programs involved with higher education institutions. After reflecting over what I learned this quarter in the colloquium, I realized it covers topics ranging from the business of higher education to understanding how I need to look introspectively at how my experiences can apply to my future career. This class has affected my assumptions and attitudes toward the world of higher education, and has given me a chance to reinforce and develop myself and explore different views of its systems.</p>

<p>Some of the more important things I learned from the colloquium concerned how I need to advertise myself, whether it be through interviews, resumes, and portfolios, and the general business and processes for developing programs and finding the right people to benefit your mission. When I say the “business side” of higher education, I am talking about the processes for developing your own programs, hiring practices for those programs, and how to find funding for your program. From my most recent memory, I reflected on the class where Jen Self from the Q Center came in and gave us the history of the Center’s development. Although she had a great deal to say about the atmosphere of the Q Center and the services it provides, I was also very interested to hear about how the Center came to existence. She talked about having to advocate, negotiate, and find ways to gain support from the institution. Further, she also talked about the process of ‘finding space wherever you can get it’, which also gave me a dose of reality about how important it is for you to have real estate on campus if you want to be a respectable, credible resource. Moreover, something she brought up was how you design a program, which included how you use your funding, what partnerships you need to seek out, and what people you should employ to make your program as effective and efficient as possible.</p>

<p>It was important to learn these processes because designing a program is something that I want to do once I enter my career in higher education. Understanding how proactive I need to be and what components I need to survive in an institution is something that I found to be truly beneficial. This seminar also reminded me of what I am doing in my current internship. Although the Q Center has been an established program for nearly a decade, it bears resemblance to the Faculty Commons at Bellevue College in that it is similar to a startup company. Having to do marketing and outreach, finding a place to call your own, and building a staff that has the passion and experience needed to bolster the program’s mission is something that is truly beneficial to the betterment of a program.</p>

<p>Secondly, another important lesson that I learned in the class was how to present myself as I plan to enter higher education. When going over how to build a resume that caters to the job you desire, how to present yourself in an interview, and how to demonstrate your strengths in an online portfolio, is useful as to how I can acquire a job. This section also brought some tension though, reminding me of my lack of experience in higher education. Seeing how others in the class have extensive experience working in student programs, teaching, or being involved in student advising is something that is intimidating. Even though I am obtaining a degree in higher education leadership, is it enough to get me the job? This question came to mind as we went over these topics in class, which did make me rethink how likely it is that I can actually get the experience I need to be a valuable asset to a school. Learning about how to emphasize my strengths, however, was important. Knowing that I may not have all the experience as others applying for jobs, I do have skills that can be invaluable to an institution. Learning about different organizations and opportunities around campus that I can participate in, is also something I learned about in class that can help me advertise my knowledge of higher education in general.</p>

<p>As far as what the colloquium taught me about leadership and success, it shed a new light on the meanings of the two. Entering into this program, my idea of leadership was “taking the reins” of projects and presenting myself as someone capable of holding authority. This class showed me that leadership is a much more dynamic concept, however. Leadership is more than having authority; it is about being proactive, inclusive, and genuine to others. I reflect back on the seminar with Ed Taylor and how he described the qualities of what he believes a leader should possess. I felt that the characteristics he described were much more than my idea of a leader, and more about being a good person to others and demonstrating pure enthusiasm and passion for what you do.</p>

<p>When it comes to success, I learned about this in a variety of contexts. Again, walking into a program that I wanted to do because I knew it would increase my value in the job market, my idea of success was just landing a job. Now, learning about the system of higher education, landing the job is just the beginning of an uphill battle. Success in higher education is not about satisfying your goals, but helping the lives of students and your colleagues. The definition of success, to me, is how the combination of how I feel about my efforts and how those efforts give others the opportunity to accomplish their goals. Someday, I could get a job at a school and design a program. I could get the funding, the space, and the staff, but does that make it a success? I mean, I technically succeeded in gathering all of the components I needed to accomplish my mission to design and institutionalize a program, but is it truly a success? I now have the understanding that, in higher education, to have success means that the people you intend to reach out to can achieve success. Thus, success is not necessarily my own personal achievement, but my personal achievement as it leads to the achievement of others.</p>

<p>All of these seminars had their own effect. Each has helped me define leadership and success, and each has given me more insight into higher education. I feel that it is a given that I can use all of this knowledge in a variety of ways in my professional career, and achieving my professional goals, however, I am unsure how. Without experiencing what it is like to work in higher education, I have never had the opportunity to assume a leadership position in a professional environment, however, this class gave me the confidence and general awareness I need for helping me identify what I need to do once a situation arises. If there were anything that could have been changed in the class to help with my learning of higher education, I would say that having more opportunity to have a class, or session, where we have round table discussions that approach questions we want to discuss would be most beneficial. As I mentioned, there are students in the class that have valuable experience in education, yet they are still unfamiliar about all of the processes behind higher education, thus, it would be interesting to see how they are able to relate what they have learned in the class to their professional experiences.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel this class was a success, and that it helped me gain an understanding of higher education through the perspectives of professionals. I consider all of the knowledge I gained in this class to be truly beneficial to my future, and to be constructive to my development. Moreover, a great thing about this class is that the material I learned is also transferable to careers outside of higher education. Although I am still passionate about working in colleges, I know that the qualities I am gaining to become a successful leader can also be invaluable to any organization that strives to help others.</p>
